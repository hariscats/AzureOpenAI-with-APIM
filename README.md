# Manage Azure OpenAI using APIM

## Overview

One-button deploy APIM, Key vault, and Log Analytics. Auto-configure APIM to work with your Azure OpenAI endpoint. 

Using Azure's APIM orchestration provides a organizations with a powerful way to scale and manage their Azure OpenAI service without deploying Azure OpenAI endpoints everywhere. Administrators can issue subscription keys via APIM for accessing a single Azure OpenAI service instead of having teams share Azure OpenAI keys. APIM delivers usage metrics along with API monitoring to improve business intelligence. APIM policies control access, throttling, and a mechanism for chargeback cost models.

Gain conceptual details and technical step-by-step knowledge on implementing APIM to support your Azure OpenAI resiliency, scalability, performance, monitoring, and charge back capabilities.

## Solutions

There are two solutions developed to meet the needs of the organization from a sandbox to model a production environment.

> [!NOTE]
>
> With Azure OpenAI's availability in Azure Government, the solutions are consolidated down because they are identical whether deployed into Azure Commercial or Azure Government.

## Using it

Once the service is deployed, use the following section to understand how to access your Azure OpenAI service via APIM.

- [Steps and examples on how to use your APIM-based API to query your Azure OpenAI API](#tying-it-all-together)

### Utilization per subscription (support Charge-back)

> [!TIP]
>
> A subscription, in the context of APIM, is the authorization of a user or group to access an API.

Calculate token counts per subscription. This can be helpful to monitor utilization of Azure OpenAI but also provides the foundation for a charge-back model if, internally, your organization provides a shared services model where Azure OpenAI is deployed and provided back to the business with one of the following models:

- For free and the team managing the service pays for all costs
- Cost basis so the team managing the service provides access to said service but requires the internal business consumer to pay for its use. 

Use the following link to deploy an APIM policy and supporting services to capture token counts by subscription using an Event hub, process them using an Azure Function, and log them to Log Analytics workspace for reporting.

- [Deploy service to monitor Azure OpenAI token count per subscription](#azure-openai-token-count-per-subscription)

### Resiliency (Retry Policy)

Resiliency is the ability of the service to recover from an issue. With regard to Azure OpenAI and APIM, this means using a Retry Policy to attempt the prompt again. Typically the prompt fails because at the time the user submitted their prompt, the Azure OpenAI endpoint was maxed out of either Tokens Per Minute or Requests Per Minute based on the endpoints quota, which triggers a HTTP 429 error.

- Retry policy to leverage two or more Azure OpenAI endpoints
- Expands capacity without impact to user experience or requesting increase to existing Azure OpenAI endpoints

Single region Retry policy means APIM will wait for a specific period of time and attempt to submit the prompt to the same Azure OpenAI endpoint. This is ok for development phases of solutions but not ideal for production.

Multi region Retry policy means APIM will immediately submit the prompt to a completely separate Azure OpenAI endpoint that is deployed to a separate Azure region. This effectively doubles your Azure OpenAI quota and provides resiliency. You can tie this together with the APIM Load Balancer capability (as of April 4, 2024, this is Azure Commercial only and in Preview) you can have scale and resiliency. This is discussed in more detail [LINK HERE]

- [Implement Resiliency](#resiliency)

### Scalability (Load Balancing)

Scalability provides the ability of your Azure OpenAI service to support higher loads without necessarily increasing regional quotas. This feature  (as of April 4, 2024, this is Azure Commercial only and in Preview) uses two or more Azure OpenAI endpoints in a round-robin load balancing configuration. This feature is not built into the One-button deploy but perspective implementation is provided so that organizations can implement.

You can tie this together with the Retry policy (as of April 4, 2024, this is Azure Commercial only and in Preview) you can have scale and resiliency. This is discussed in more detail [LINK HERE]

- [Implement Scalability](#scalability)

### Performance (Provisioned Throughput Units)

Scale provides ability of an organization to support higher loads by leveraging multiple regions but the TPM cost model is a best effort compute with no SLAs. When using TPM pay as you go model, as long as your Azure OpenAI endpoint has quota - your prompts will be processed but their latency may be higher than anticipated and variability may be more inconsistent than anticipated.

To improve performance, Azure OpenAI has a cost model called Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU). When using PTUs, the organization is procuring an allotted amount of GPU to process their models. No other organization or individual can use that GPU. This has a positive effect of reducing latency and tightening up the variability in latency. It has a secondary effect of improving [cost forecasting](#cost-forecasting-provisioned-throughput-units-+-rate-limiting) (discussed in more detail further in this article). 

- [Implement Performance](#performance)

#### Implementing Priority-based Routing

To effectively manage performance and resource utilization, you can implement priority-based routing in Azure API Management (APIM). This allows you to direct high-priority requests to more performant (and potentially more costly) PTU endpoints, while routing lower-priority requests to standard pay-as-you-go endpoints.

#### APIM Policy Configuration

Below is an example of an APIM policy that routes requests based on the `Priority` header value:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <!-- Check if the Priority header exists -->
        <set-variable name="priorityValue" value="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("Priority", "0"))" />

        <!-- Convert the priorityValue to an integer -->
        <set-variable name="priorityInt" value="@{
            int priority;
            return int.TryParse((string)context.Variables["priorityValue"], out priority) ? priority : 0;
        }" />

        <!-- Conditional routing based on priorityInt -->
        <choose>
            <!-- Route to PTU Endpoint if Priority is between 0 and 100 -->
            <when condition="@(context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") >= 0 && context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") <= 100)">
                <set-backend-service backend-id="aoai-ptu-backend" />
            </when>
            <!-- Route to Regional Endpoint if Priority is between 101 and 500 -->
            <when condition="@(context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") >= 101 && context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") <= 500)">
                <set-backend-service backend-id="aoai-regional-backend" />
            </when>
            <!-- Route to Data Zone Deployment if Priority is between 501 and 1000 -->
            <when condition="@(context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") >= 501 && context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<int>("priorityInt") <= 1000)">
                <set-backend-service backend-id="aoai-data_zone-backend" />
            </when>
            <!-- Default routing using Circuit Breaker pool if Priority header is missing or out of range -->
            <otherwise>
                <set-backend-service backend-id="aoai-circuit_breaker-backend" />
            </otherwise>
        </choose>
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
    <on-error>
        <base />
    </on-error>
</policies>

```

**Explanation:**

- **Set Variable `priorityValue`:** Retrieves the `Priority` header value from the incoming request. If it's missing, it defaults to `"0"`.
- **Set Variable `priorityInt`:** Converts the `priorityValue` to an integer for comparison purposes.
- **Conditional Routing with `<choose>`:**
  - **First `<when>` Condition:** Routes to the PTU Endpoint if `Priority` is between **0 and 100**.
  - **Second `<when>` Condition:** Routes to the Regional Endpoint if `Priority` is between **101 and 500**.
  - **Third `<when>` Condition:** Routes to the Data zone Deployment if `Priority` is between **501 and 1000**.
  - **`<otherwise>` Condition:** Routes to a default endpoint using a Circuit Breaker pool if the `Priority` header is missing or doesn't match any of the defined conditions.

**Notes:**

- Replace the `base-url` in `<set-backend-service>` with your actual endpoint URLs.
- Ensure that the priority ranges are correctly defined and non-overlapping.
- This policy should be added to the inbound section of your APIM policy configuration.

#### HTTP Header Configuration

To make this routing work, clients need to include the `Priority` header in their HTTP requests.

- **HTTP Request Header:**
  - **Header Name:** `Priority`
  - **Header Value:** An integer between **0 and 1000** depending on the desired priority level.

**Example HTTP Request:**

```http
POST /apim/url HTTP/1.1
Host: your-apim-instance.azure-api.net
Priority: 50
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-access-token

{
    "your": "request-body"
}
```

### Access Control

#### Managed Identity

**APIM to Azure OpenAI**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The latest update to this repo moves to Managed Identity for the one-button deployments and guides for modifying existing APIM services.

Managed identities is the ideal method for authenticating APIM to Azure OpenAI. This eliminates the need to manage the rotation of keys and for keys to be stored anywhere beyond the Azure OpenAI endpoint. 

- [Implement authenticating APIM to Azure OpenAI using Managed Identity](#apim-to-azure-openai)

**Client or Application to APIM**

Managed identities of the Azure App Service, Virtual Machine, Azure Kubernetes Service, or any other compute service in Azure is the preferred method of authentication. It improves security and eliminates the issuance of keys and tokens. Clients can use an OAuth token if required to validate access when using Azure OpenAI via APIM.

These methods shifts the burden of authentication from the application and onto APIM, which improves performance, scalability, operational management, and identity service selection. Update APIM's identity provider for OAuth and that update flows down to the application without any modification to the application.  

The examples provide both methods along with guidance on how to setup the client or application to run the code so that managed identity technique can be used.

- [Implement authenticating application to APIM using Managed Identity](#application-to-apim)
- [Implement authenticating client to APIM using Entra](#client-to-apim)

#### Tokens and Keys

**APIM to Azure OpenAI SAS Token**

Subscription key is like a SAS token provided by the backend service but it is issued by APIM for use by the user or group. These are fine during the development phase. We've retained the policy xml file in the repo as an example but this technique is not used.

- [Implement authenticating APIM to Azure OpenAI using SAS](#apim-to-azure-openai-sas-token)

**Client or Application to APIM**

For development and when running test commands from your workstation, using the Subscription key is straightforward but we recommend moving from the Subscription key to Managed Identities beyond development. The examples provide both methods along with guidance on how to setup the client or application to run the code so that managed identity technique can be used.

### API Management to Azure OpenAI

Use API management deployed to your Azure environment using public IP addresses for accessing APIM and for APIM to access the Azure OpenAI API. Access to the services is secured using keys and Defender for Cloud. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> Only API Management Service is deployed, this solution requires the Azure OpenAI service to already exist.

![API Management to Azure OpenAI](./images/apim-to-aoai.png)

1. Users and Groups are used to assign access to an API using subscriptions.
   1. Each User or Group can be assigned their own policies like rate-limiting to control use
2. The Azure OpenAI API uses policies to assign backends, retry, rate-throttling, and token counts.
3. The backends are assigned using a policy and can include load balance groups. Retry policies reference additional backends for resiliency.
4. One or more Azure OpenAI service (endpoint) can be used to manage scale and resiliency.
   1. The endpoints will reside in different regions so that they can utilize the maximum quota available to them.
5. Policies are used to collect information, perform actions, and manipulate user connections.
6. App Insights are used to create dashboards to monitor performance and use.

#### Deploy

**! NOTE !** - It can take up to 45 minutes for all services to deploy as API Management has many underlying Azure resources deployed running the service.

## Tying it All together

Read through the following steps to setup interacting with APIM and how to use consoles or .net to programatically interact with Azure OpenAI via APIM.

### Get your Azure OpenAI Model Name

To determine if you have one or more models deployed, visit the AI Studio. Here you can determine if you need to create a model or use an existing model. You will use the model name when quering the Azure OpenAI API via your APIM.

![Get your Azure OpenAI Model Name](./images/get-your-aoai-model-name.png)

1. Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource in Azure
2. Select **Model deployments**
3. Select **Manage Deployments**

4. Review your models and copy the **Deployment name** of the model you want to use

### Get your APIM Subscription Key

The subscription key for APIM is collected at the Subscription section of the APIM resource, regardless if you are in Azure Commercial or Government.

You can use this key for testing or as an example on how to create subscriptions to provide access to you Azure OpenAI service. Instead of sharing your Azure OpenAI Key, you create subscriptions in APIM and share this key, then you can analyze and monitor usage, provide guardrails for usage, and manage access.

![Get your APIM Subscription Key](./images/get-your-apim-sub-key.png)

1. Navigate to your new APIM
2. Select **Subscriptions** from the menu
3. Select **...**
4. Select **Show/Hide keys**
5. Select **copy icon**

### Get your APIM Azure OpenAI URL

The URL for APIM is collected at the Overview section of the APIM resource, regardless if you are in Azure Commercial or Government.

![Get your APIM Azure OpenAI URL](./images/get-your-apim-url.png)

### Query Examples

Using your Azure OpenAI model, API version, APIM URL, and APIM subscription key you can now execute Azure OpenAI queries against your APIM URL instead of your Azure OpenAI URL. This means you can create new subscription keys for anyone or any team who needs access to Azure OpenAI instead of deploying new Azure OpenAI services.
